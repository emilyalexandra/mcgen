Templates are groups of json files to be used to generate a file given an
identifier. They are located at ~/.mcgen/templates/<template> containing
some of the following:
	item_model.json
	block_state.json
	block_model.json
	block_item_model.json
	block_loot_table.json
Using the template will replace the built in template for those file types.
If multiple template flags are passed, the first passed will have priority.
